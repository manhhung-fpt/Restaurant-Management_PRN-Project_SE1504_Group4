# Welcome to Restaurant Management Desktop Application

### Business opportunity and Problem

* For a restaurant to run efficiently, a business owner or store manager must keep track of and handle a massive workload. Traditional manual restaurant management is not only prone to errors and mistakes, but also consumes a lot of money. Restaurant management software was born and has become an extremely effective "technology assistant" to support the management and control of business activities of managers.

### This system supports the following types of users:

* Employees: They work in the restaurant, work with customers and perform table transfers, track and pay bills for dining tables.

* Admin: They work with issues in the restaurant such as paying the table bill, tracking and managing sales, inventory, and restaurant staff.
